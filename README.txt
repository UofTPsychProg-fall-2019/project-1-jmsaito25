Recognition-induced memory bias paradigm

1. Run color_wheel_create.py to first create a PNG image of the color wheel that will be used on every trial

2. Modify the number of trials that you want to complete. To do this, change the the trial range in line 173 to reflect the number of trials you'd like to complete. The default is 200 trials, reflected in the current code. The final output data frame is concatenated in a manner that is flexible to less than total trials (200).

3. Review the task instructions below & the attached task schematic, as they are not contained in the experiment script and are intended to be read aloud to participants.

Task Instructions

In this task, you will be asked to remember colored circles.

There are two types of trials in this task: 
In one, you will be presented with a colored circle for about one and a half seconds. Your job is to remember the color of this circle throughout the entire trial. After one and a half seconds, the circle will disappear and there will be a brief delay. Then you will be presented with a color wheel. From the color wheel, you will use the mouse to click on the color that matches the one of the circle that you are remembering. After clicking on the wheel, a circle will appear in the middle of the screen that is shown in the color you’ve clicked on. If this circle matches the one you are remembering, great! If it’s not quite right, you may use the left and right arrow keys to adjust the shade of the color to perfectly match the color you saw originally. The more you need to adjust the color, the more you press one of the arrow keys. Once you are done adjusting the color to match what you remember, you can submit your confidence in this answer—1 indicates that your answer is “definitely” the same color as what you saw originally, 2 indicates that it is “maybe” the same color but you are unsure, and 3 indicates that you are “guessing”. Once you submit your answer with a confidence rating, the circle will disappear from the screen and you can begin the next trial by clicking the space bar.

In the second trial type, you will be asked to make a similarity judgment before selecting the remembered color from the color wheel. Specifically, after the original color is done being presented, you will be presented with a new colored circle in the middle of the screen. Your job is to indicate whether or not you think this new circle is “similar” or “dissimilar” to the one you are remembering. You will indicate your answer by pressing 1 for “similar” or 0 for “dissimilar”. You must make this judgment and indicate your answer within 1.6 seconds while the new circle is on the screen. If you do not respond within 1.6 seconds, your response will not be recorded. After you’ve completed the similarity judgment, the color wheel will appear and you will select the color of the circle that you have been remembering. After clicking the color on the wheel, a circle will appear that is shown in the color you’ve clicked, and you can adjust the shade of the color using the left and right arrow keys. Once you are done adjusting the color, you can submit your confidence in this answer using 1 for “definitely the same”, 2 for “maybe the same, and 3 for “guessing”. Once you submit your answer with a confidence rating, the circle will disappear and you can begin the next trial by clicking the space bar.”
